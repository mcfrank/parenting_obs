Here we look at one of the regressions from Experiment 1 in detail in order to explain and illustrate the rationale of the Bayesian analysis, in particular the *probability of direction* (*pd*) and the 89% CI (credible interval). For this example we take the exploratory regression from Experiment 1 predicting parents' rate of word types with fixed effects of condition (*No Video* or *Activity Video*), each subscale of the EPAQ (EL: Early Learning, AA: Affection and Attachment, and RR: Rules & Respect), parent education (parent_ed), the child's age (centered) and gender. The model also included interactions for condition and each subscale of the EPAQ, as well as a random intecept for each video.
The model syntax was: types \~ condition\*EL + condition\*AA + condition\*RR  + age + gender + parent_ed + (1|video).
Table 1 reports the mean of each coefficient's posterior distribution, along with the lower and upper bounds for the 89% credible interval, and the probability of direction (*pd*).

```{r, run-regression, echo=F, include=F}
types_modE <- stan_glmer(paste("types", e1model_string), data=e1ld) 
summary(types_modE) 
diagnostic_posterior(types_modE) 

e1ed = get_stan_glmer_reporting_values(types_modE, 'parent_ed') 
pd = p_direction(types_modE, effects="fixed") # cond 82.5% EL 82.5% AA 87% genderM 93.2%, parent_ed 93.5% cond:AA 94.5%


tok_modE1 <- stan_glmer(paste("tokens", e1model_string), data=e1ld) 
mtld_modE1 <- stan_glmer(paste("MTLD", e1model_string), data=e1ld) 
ttr_modE1 <- stan_glmer(paste("TTR", e1model_string), data=e1ld) 
```


```{r, p-direction, echo=F, fig.cap="Mean, *pd*, and 89% CIs of the coefficient posterior distributions."}

cols = c("Mean","89% CI Lower","89% CI Upper")
pd[,cols] = NA
for(i in 2:nrow(pd)) {
  tmp = get_stan_glmer_reporting_values(types_modE, pd[i,]$Parameter) 
  pd[i,cols] = c(tmp[pd[i,]$Parameter], tmp["89pLB"], tmp["89pUB"])
}
kable(pd[2:nrow(pd),c("Parameter","pd", cols)], digits=2, row.names=F)
```

What do these values mean? 
Let's take a closer look at the posterior distribution of the parent education (parent_ed) coefficient. 
Shown below in Figure 1, the 87% of this distribution that is greater than 0 is shaded orange, which corresponds to the probability of direction *pd* = 0.87, which has the straightforward interpretation of being the probability that an effect has the same sign as the median value of the posterior. Thus, *pd* has a range of 0.5 (if the distribution is equally-distributed around 0: a likely true null effect) to 1.0 (if the posterior is entirely positive or negative).
Since *pd* < 0.95 in this case (corresponding to a $p$<.05 threshold in the null hypothesis significance-testing framework), we do not consider parent education to have a notable effect on the rate of types used during play, but the posterior distribution is interpretable.
Also shown are the mean estimated coefficient value (red line) and 89% credible intervals (blue lines), within which 89% of the posterior distribution falls.

```{r, parent-ed-effect, echo=F, fig.cap="Posterior distribution of parent education coefficient with mean (red), 89% CIs (blue), and *pd* (orange portion) shown.", fig.width=4, fig.height=2.0, warning=F}
dat = types_modE %>% posterior_samples("parent_ed") %>%
  estimate_density(extend=TRUE)

  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_area(fill="grey") +
  geom_ribbon(data=subset(dat, x>0),aes(ymax=y),ymin=0,

  geom_vline(xintercept=e1ed["parent_ed"], size=1, color="red")
```

Figure 2 shows the posteriors for all of the coefficients in this regression. 
Only the interaction between condition and the Affection and Attachment subscale of the EPAQ was notable (by *pd* in Table 1), but as indicated by their *pd* values, much of the mass some other parameters' posteriors are skewed negative (e.g., conditionexp: the Activity Video condition; EL: the Early Learning subscale of the EPAQ), while others are more evenly-distributed (e.g., RR, $pd$ = 0.51).
